QS7.1: For which of the test cases do you notice differences emerging in the shading of the squares? Can you explain why some squares get lighter and some squares get darker?

A7.1: I only notice significant differences in shading in the second and third tests, but (I think?) I see very light differences in shading in some of the farthest corners of the fourth test. From what I understand about the ghost movements, they generally try to stay away from corners and dead ends most of the time if not given a specific place to move. Additionally, in the case of the second test, the ghost only moves around the bottom of the enclosed loop, never straying towards the top. So, if I had to give a guess as to why the squares change in shade, I would say that the lighter shades represent squares where the ghost is more likely to visit, while darker shades represent squares the ghost will very rarely visit, if ever.
